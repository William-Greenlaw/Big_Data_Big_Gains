## Physical Therapy 2019
This routine setup began with formal physical therapy on February 28th, 2019, at the Professional Physical Therapy practice. It focuses on improving chronic injuries, aches, and pains in the lower extremeties dating back since 2014 in high school, including:
- Weakness and pain in the right achilles tendon
- Weakness and pain in the right knee
- Weakness and pain in the right instep

The basic goals of physical therapy are as follows:
- Reduce weakness and pain in all three body parts
- Build strength in all three body parts
- Build power generation for impact exercises

The "proctored" sessions of physical therapy ended in April 16th, 2019; solo-sessions using prescribed exercises began directly afterwards. Given that physical therapy is for my lower extremities, this routine will also focus on cardio to help build work capacity for other lifts. Physical therapy goals here are indexed to certain metrics:

Number of Workouts: Twice per week, normal load and volume progression. Attempt to increase weight each week; if higher weight is painful, reduce weight for a session. If not, continue the new weight.

- Legs
    - Level 1: Pain reduction
        - Be able to walk most days without right instep pain
        - Be able to walk most days withought right knee pain
        - Be able to walk most days without right achilles tendon pain
    - Level 2: Strength building
        - Be able to barbell front squat at least bodyweight without pain
        - Be able to romanian deadlift at least bodyweight without pain
        
        After level two goals have been met, transition into a normal lower body routine
      
    - Level 3: Power and impact building
        - Be able to jog, jump-rope, and other moderate impact exercise without pain
        - Be able to do martial arts and high impact training without pain
- Cardio
