# Legacy Code
This code was designed to interface with the Fitbit API to download my biometric data. This was done because manual downloads from Fitbit failed to provide the granular intraday data this project was looking for. API interaction relied upon an open-source python Fitbit module that has since been broken by changes to the Fitbit API. I now download Fitbit data manually from Fitbit; since the writing of this code, intraday biometric information has been made available from bulk download from Fitbit. While an annoyance, this is easier and faster than retooling OAuth credential systems and navigating burdensome REST API rate limits. The code, but not the original downloaded files, remains here for future reference in case interacting with Fitbit's API becomes a better option than downloading manually.
