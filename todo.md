# Todo
## Database Work
[] Flatten Fitbit intraday data into separate tables
[] Create a separate table with a list of exercises
[] Merge duration, start, and end time of workout into workout meta-data
[] Record how many light, moderate, and heavy repetitions
[] Resolve the pull-up, chin-up definition problem
[] Merge together duplicate exercise names
    - Decline Cable Fly -> Low Cable Cross-Over

## Analyses
[x] Write golden ratio range axis function for line charts that don't go to zero
[] Sleep analysis
[] Total time resting vs. total time working out
[] % of time in heart rate zones
[] Calculate relative volumes
[] Revisit how to do body measurements to track progress
[] Track the intensity of each set; I.E. % of 1RM, 60%, 75%, 85% etc.
    - This would require calculating 1RMs at the beginning of the workout routine.
[] Revisit how to quantify ab work when comparing bodyweight to weighted exercises
[] Add my estimated bodyweight to all variations of dips and pull-ups

Things to learn
- Proper warmup load strategy
    - Dynamic stretching warmup and post-workout cooldown specific to the day in the routine.
- Load progression strategy
- Cardio/work capacity strategy
- 1 rep max selection and routine selection strategy
- Design a routine with multiple days per body part to split up the volume
- Fix primary lift and category issue that doesn't label when only cardio has been done
