# Todo
## Database Work
[] Flatten Fitbit intraday data into separate tables
[] Create a separate table with a list of exercises
[] Add my estimated bodyweight to all variations of dips and pull-ups
[] Merge duration, start, and end time of workout into workout meta-data
[] Record how many light, moderate, and heavy repetitions

## Analyses
[] Sleep analysis
[] Total time resting vs. total time working out
[] % of time in heart rate zones
[] Calculate relative volumes

Problem areas
[] Revisit abs with my bodyweight

Things to learn
- Proper warmup load strategy
    - Dynamic stretching warmup and post-workout cooldown specific to the day in the routine.
- Load progression strategy
- Cardio/work capacity strategy
- 1 rep max selection and routine selection strategy
- Design a routine with multiple days per body part to split up the volume
- Fix primary lift and category issue that doesn't label when only cardio has been done
